    <h1>About Home-EyeCare</h1>
    <p>
        Welcome to **Home-EyeCare**, an initiative designed to provide an affordable and accessible eye-testing solution.
        Our goal is to help individuals test their eyesight at home using simple online tools and scientifically backed measurements.
        By selecting your screen resolution and viewing distance, we calculate an approximate diopter value to assess visual acuity.
    </p>

    <p>
        This project was created to help people detect early signs of vision impairment without expensive equipment.
        Our system follows a standard Snellen chart principle, ensuring accuracy within practical limits.

    <p>Thank you for trusting Home-EyeCare!</p>
